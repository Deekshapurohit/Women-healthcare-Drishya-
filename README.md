# Women-healthcare-Drishya-
This website aims to provide period packs and sanitary napkins to the women who are underprivileged and could not afford to buy one. “Women healthcare” is a website that has 4 panels (Donor, Needy, Medical store and admin). We are trying to build a community of active volunteers who can join us to support the cause. We target one city and currently working in Bhopal to eradicate period poverty. We are providing a secure web portal for those who want to seek help as well as want to help. The medical shops can provide discounts on various products such as heating pads, medicines as well as sanitary napkins. The needy can avail the discount by showing message to the shopkeeper which is send by the admin. The needy can avail the product once in a month.
